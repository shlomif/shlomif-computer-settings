Motivation for this plugin:
---------------------------

When searching through code one often needs to add more related
terms to the search. For example, if I found a call to a function inside
a different one, or when a type is typedef'ed to something else (in C).
This module aims to allow you to convenietly add search terms to the search
so you can find all the occurences of all of them.
To use: put this in ~/.vim/plugin/ , which can be typed by installing the
Ruby rake package and typing "rake install".

Then you can type <Leader>** to add a search term to the search (mnemonic -
* is the namespace and '*' searches forward for a keyword) and <Leader>## to
add a search term to the search and search backwards (mnemonic -
## like the vim # command).

<Leader>** 

    Add the pattern matched by "*" to the search and searches forward in the
    current search pattern.

<Leader>##

    Add the pattern matched by "#" to the search and searches backward in
    the current search pattern.

The code for this plugin can be found on GitHub:

Forks, issue reports, and pull requests would be welcome.

Some of the stuff I'd like to add to this plugin:

1. Add commands corresponding to other * and #-like commands:

g*
g#

2. Add some colon commands to add more keywords to the search.

Enjoy!
