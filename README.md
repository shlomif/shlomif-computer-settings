# About

This repository contains the configuration/etc. home directory
files of [Shlomi Fish](http://www.shlomifish.org/) that he made public.
Repositories like this are commonly called “dotfiles” but this repository
is organised differently.

## Quick start

You can automatically set up most settings (but please do it in a new
[OS user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_software) that can
be discarded; at least at first) using:

```
wget https://shlom.in/setup
perl setup
```

The URL refers to [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shlomif/shlomif-computer-settings/master/shlomif-settings/setup-all/setup-all.pl) .
