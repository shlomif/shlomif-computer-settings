# About

This repository contains the configuration/etc. home directory
files of [Shlomi Fish](http://www.shlomifish.org/) that he made public.
Repositories like this are commonly called “dotfiles” but this repository
is organised differently.

## WARNING!!!

This repository reflects my preferences which most probably differ from
yours. While you can read its code to learn from, and use parts of it
in your own configuration, using it as a whole is not recommended.

## Quick start

You can automatically set up most settings (but please do it in a new
[OS user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_software) that can
be discarded; at least at first) using:

```
wget https://shlom.in/setup
perl setup
```

The URL refers to [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shlomif/shlomif-computer-settings/master/shlomif-settings/setup-all/setup-all.pl) .
